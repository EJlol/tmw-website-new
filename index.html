            So you want to help this project, but you have little or no idea how to get into it? For starters, just start doing something. You don't need to apply to anyone or ask for "being taken into the team". You don't have to ask for permission to work on something or wait for someone to assign a task to you. A team member is basically anyone who volunteers to do something for the game.
